# include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World " << std::endl;
}

/* Notes:
* This is not the best way to do this (chatgpt)
* I do not need to flush this because when main ends it will flush the buffer anyway.
* I forgot the return 0 statement.
* I will rewrite again in hello_world2.
